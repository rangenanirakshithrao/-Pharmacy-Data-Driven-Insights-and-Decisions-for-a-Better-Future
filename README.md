# Pharmacy Data-Driven Insights and Decisions for a Better Future

**Duration**: August 2023 - October 2023  
**Associated with**: University of North Texas  

## Project Overview  
This project explores a pharmacy wholesale dataset to derive actionable insights and create strategies for improving business outcomes. By analyzing revenue, gross profit, dosage trends, distributor performance, and geographical data, the project provides a comprehensive understanding of the pharmacy sector's dynamics.

## Dataset Description  
The dataset includes attributes like:  
- **Pharmacy orders**: Drug name, dosage type, route, market segment, and distributor details.  
- **Sales data**: Units sold, retail sales price, total order revenue, MSRP, wholesale cost, gross profit, and margins.  
- **Geographical data**: Dispensed region, state, zip code.  

## Key Findings  
1. **Gross Profit Trends**:  
   - 2014 had the highest gross profit, indicating a peak in profitability.  
   - Consistent performance observed in 2013 and 2015.  

2. **Top Revenue-Generating Insights**:  
   - **State**: Idaho led in revenue generation.  
   - **Dosage Type**: Cream dosage type contributed 30% of total revenue.  
   - **Drugs**: Drug_76, Drug_341, and Drug_841 were top-selling.  

3. **Distributor Performance**:  
   - Distributor B outperformed others in both unit sales and gross profit.  

4. **Sales vs. Revenue Analysis**:  
   - High unit sales in 2012 did not correspond to peak revenue, which occurred in 2014.  

## Data Visualizations  
Interactive dashboards created in **Tableau** included:  
- Map views for geographic trends.  
- Bar and pie charts to represent dosage and revenue distribution.  
- Line graphs for year-on-year trends in gross profit and unit sales.

## Recommendations  
- Allocate marketing resources to high-demand areas like Idaho and popular dosage types like cream.  
- Enhance customer engagement and retention strategies in high-performing states.  
- Optimize distributor relationships, leveraging Distributor B's success model.  
- Conduct a deeper analysis of the 2012 vs. 2014 revenue discrepancy to refine future strategies.  

## Tools & Technologies  
- **Tableau**: For data visualization and trend analysis.  
- **Data Analysis**: Insights derived from multi-dimensional data attributes.  

## Conclusion  
The project offers a data-driven approach to understanding pharmacy sales, emphasizing trends and strategies for enhanced decision-making and growth.
